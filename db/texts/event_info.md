## 2016 Call for Proposals (CFP)

This is where you'd put text you want people to see before they start filling in the CFP form. Some suggested sections are below.

### About You

### Topics

### Proposal Details

### Proposal Form

The proposal form is divided into four sections, each used as criteria for acceptance:

_Talk Information_: is the primary data used during proposal evaluation and selection. Please help us avoid unconscious/unintentional bias by not including personally identifying information in this section, including gendered pronouns, websites, or company names.

_Balancing Information_: is used to provide contextual information about proposals and how they would fit together as a whole conference. There are no wrong answers to these questions!

_Personal &amp; Contact Information_:  __We will never share or publish any of your information without your explicit permission.__ If you are selected to be a presenter, we will contact you for permission to share some details (like your name and twitter handle) on the website. Demographic information is optional and will only be used to support our goal of having a diverse and inclusive environment.

_Making Life Easier_: The questions here only come into play if you are chosen to be a presenter. The information collected here does not factor into the selection process. Rather, it makes it easier for us to move forward with you as a speaker. We will be able to publicize and celebrate your selection, order swag earlier, and update our website as soon as you confirm your selection.

### Selection Process

Here's the basic timeline of how we will move from collecting proposals to announcing the conference lineup:

1. __Open &amp; Publicize the CFP:__ The CFP opens __start date__. We will accept proposals through the end of __end date__ (end time, time zone).

1. __Evaluate proposals__: Given the timeline we will begin reviewing submitted proposals on a rolling basis. The review process will proceed through phases. These phases are set up to both review presentation ideas on their own merits and also ensuring we get diverse ideas and speakers.

1. __Contact everyone:__ We will reach out to selected presenters and alternates to confirm their inclusion. We will also contact submitters not selected as a presenter or alternate so that no one is left guessing.

1. __Finalize and release lineup:__ Once all of our presenters and alternates have confirmed their participation, we will announce the final presenter lineup on both the website and Twitter.

### Completing the CFP form
