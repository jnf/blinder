## 2016 Call for Proposals (CFP)

Hello! We look forward to reviewing a wide range of proposals for presentations at Open Source & Feelings. The info on this page will help you prepare for submitting your proposal. Youâ€™ll find the link to the proposal form at the bottom of this page.

**Note:** _Proposers will receive a 50% discount on their tickets. Speakers will receive free tickets._

### About You

You have feelings. You care about open source. Maybe you have thoughts on how we can work better in our open source communities. Maybe you have thoughts on how our humanity impacts our OS work, or vice versa. Perhaps you've read through [our wishlist](http://osfeels.com/talk-ideas) and something caught your eye. When you heard about this conference you had an idea that you just knew would fit.

We look forward to broad diversity in our speakers, presentation formats, and topics.

### Topics

We are interested in practical information that our participants can take back with them to their open source communities. We are interested in authentic presentations opening up needed conversations in the larger community. [Our wishlist](http://osfeels.com/talk-ideas) may be helpful to get the ideas flowing.

### Proposal Details

Pick a format for your presentation. This could be a formal talk, panel, activity, spoken word, musical or dramatic performance, or anything else.

Choose a length for your presentation. Most are between 10 and 40 minutes.

You can submit multiple proposals for presentation, but any single person will present only once at Open Source & Feelings.

You must read and follow our [code of conduct](http://osfeels.com/conduct).

### Proposal Form

The proposal form is divided into four sections, each used as criteria for acceptance:

_Talk Information_: is the primary data used during proposal evaluation and selection. Please help us avoid unconscious/unintentional bias by not including personally identifying information in this section, including gendered pronouns, websites, or company names.

_Balancing Information_: is used to provide contextual information about proposals and how they would fit together as a whole conference. There are no wrong answers to these questions!

_Personal &amp; Contact Information_:  __We will never share or publish any of your information without your explicit permission.__ If you are selected to be a presenter, we will contact you for permission to share some details (like your name and twitter handle) on the Open Source and Feelings website. Demographic information is optional and will only be used to support our goal of having a diverse and inclusive environment.

_Making Life Easier_: The questions here only come into play if you are chosen to be a presenter. The information collected here does not factor into the selection process. Rather, it makes it easier for us to move forward with you as a speaker. We will be able to publicize and celebrate your selection, order swag earlier, and update our website as soon as you confirm your selection.

### Selection Process

Here's the basic timeline of how we will move from collecting proposals to announcing the conference lineup:

1. __Open &amp; Publicize the CFP:__ The CFP opens __Friday, 4 March 2016__. We will accept proposals through the end of __Friday, 1 April 2016__ (11:59pm Pacific Standard Time).

1. __Evaluate proposals__: Given the timeline we will begin reviewing submitted proposals on a rolling basis. The review process will proceed through phases. These phases are set up to both review presentation ideas on their own merits and also ensuring we get diverse ideas and speakers.

1. __Contact everyone:__ We will reach out to selected presenters and alternates to confirm their inclusion. We will also contact submitters not selected as a presenter or alternate so that no one is left guessing.

1. __Finalize and release lineup:__ Once all of our presenters and alternates have confirmed their participation, we will announce the final presenter lineup on both the OSFeels website and Twitter.

### Completing the CFP form

Required fields are marked with a red asterisk
(<span class="required">*</span>). After you submit your proposal, you'll receive both a browser and email confirmation of your submission.

__If you have any problems or concerns with the form or the process, please reach out via email to [cfp@osfeels.com](mailto:cfp@osfeels.com). That address goes directly to OSFeels organizers tasked with ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to participate in this process and who have recused themselves from the non-identifying rounds of review.__
